### Operating Systems

- An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer
hardware components and the user. Every computer system must have at least one OS to
run other programs.
- Applications such as Browsers, MS Office, Notepad Games, etc., need some environment
to run and perform its tasks.
- The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the
computer’s language. It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device
without having an operating system.

### Management and Support

What does an OS manage and support?

- Manages hardware.
- Supports applications.
- Provides an interface for the user.
- Manages I/O.

### Operating System Functions

### Operating System Functions Explained

- Process management: Process management helps the OS to create and delete
processes.
- Memory management: Memory management modules perform the task of
allocation and deallocation of memory space to programs.
- File management: File management manages all the file-related activities such
as organization storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.
- Device management: Device management keeps tracks of all devices. This
module is also responsible for the task known as the I/O controller.
- I/O System management: One of the main objects of any OS is to hide the
peculiarities of that hardware device from the user.
- Secondary-Storage management: Systems have several levels of storage,
which includes primary storage, secondary storage, and cache storage.
Instructions and data must be stored in primary storage or cache so that a
running program can reference it.
- Security: Security module protects the data and information of a computer
system against a malware threat, and unauthorized access.
- Command Interpretation: This module interprets commands given by the
acting system resources to process that commands.
- Networking: A distributed system is a group of processors, which do not share
memory, hardware devices, or a clock. The processors communicate with one
another through the network.
- Job accounting: Keeping track of time and resources used by various jobs and
users.
- Communication management: Coordination and assignment of compilers,
interpreters, and another software resources of the various users of the
computer systems.

### User Interfaces of Opertin Systems

A **User Interface (UI)** facilitates communication between an application and its user by acting
as an intermediary between them. The User Interface takes the inputs from the user to provide the output to the users.

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** : The Graphical User Interface is a type of interface that
enables the users to interact with the operating system by means of point-and-click
operations. GUIs is easy to understand and even new users can operate on them on their
own.
2. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The Command Line Interface is a type of user interface
that enables the users to interact with the OS by issuing some specific commands. The
disadvantages of the CLI is that the user needs to remember a lot to interact with the OS.
Therefore, these types of interfaces are not considered very friendly from a user
perspective.

**Example:** In order to perform a task, we need to type a command at the command prompt
denoted by **C:\>** dir.

### Command Line Interface

During the early days of
computers, there was no
mouse available for the
operating system, and
users could only interact
with the system by typing
commands in the
Command Line Interface
(CLI).

### List of Operating Systems

[Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operating_systems)

### Overview of Linux

- Linux is an *operating system* or the *Kernel* – **the central controller.**
- Linux is also distributed under an open-source license. Open-source licenses
follow these key tenets:
14
  - You can install Linux on as many computers as you like without
paying any fees for software or server licensing.
  - You have the freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
  - You have the freedom to study how the program works, and
change it to make it do what you wish.
  - You have the freedom to redistribute copies so you can help
others.
  - You have the freedom to distribute copies of your modified
versions to others.
- Kernel – This is the one piece of the whole that is actually
called ‘Linux.’ The kernel is the core of the system and
manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The
kernel is the lowest level of the OS.
Visit the Wiki document for more information about the Kernel.
- Shell − An interface to Kernel that hides the complexity of
the Kernel's functions from users. The shell takes
commands from the user and executes the Kernel's
functions.

### Linux Distribution

- Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. New users and hard-core
users will find a “flavor” of Linux to match their needs. These versions are called
**distributions** (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on many
machines).
- Popular Linux OS distributions include:
  - LINUX MINT
  - MANJARO
  - DEBIAN
  - UBUNTU
  - ANTERGOS
  - SOLUS
  - FEDORA
  - ELEMENTARY OS
  - OPENSUSE

- **Linux Server OS includes:**
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  - Ubuntu Server
  - Centos
  - SUSE Enterprise Linux

Some of the above server distributions are free (e.g., Ubuntu Server and CentOS),
and some have an associated price (e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE
Enterprise Linux).

### Linux on Various Types of Hardware

![Linux on Various Hardware]()

### Overview - Windows Operating System

- *Windows* is a graphical OS developed by *Microsoft*. It allows users to view and store files, run
software, play games, watch videos, and it provides a way to connect to the internet. It
was released for both home computing and professional work.
- There are two common editions of Windows:
  - Windows Home
  - Windows Professional
- **Windows Server** (formerly **Windows NT Server**) is a group of *OS* for servers that *Microsoft* has
been developing since July 27, 1993.
- Windows comes in three architectures: *32-bit*, *64-bit*, and *x86-bit*.
  - The 86-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory
(RAM) more effectively than a 64-bit system. To run an 86-bit version of Windows,
your computer must have an 86-bit-capable processor.
- The Windows OS License is distributed under a *Proprietary commercial software license*.

### Overview - Macintosh Operating System

- **The Macintosh Operating System MacOS** (previously **Mac OS X**, and later **OS X**) is built on top of a *Unix* operating system, developed and marketed by *Apple Inc. (2001)*. It is the primary OS for Apple's *Macintosh computers*. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers, it is the *second most widely used desktop OS* after *Microsoft Windows*.
- MacOS is a GUI-based OS that has since been released in multiple different versions.
- Apple's business model is mainly based on differentiation and exclusivity. Unlike Microsoft,
Apple makes both the hardware and software of their products, and Apple's software runs
only on their machines.

### Summary

An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer
hardware components and the user. Every computer system must have at least one OS to run
other programs.

- Linux is an *operating system* or the *kernel* – **the central controller**.
- Microsoft Windows (also referred to as Windows or Win) is a **graphical operating system developed and published by Microsoft**.

The User Interface takes the inputs from the user to provide the output to the users.
