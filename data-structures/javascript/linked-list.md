# Linked List

- A Linked List is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.
- It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
- In its most basic form, each node contains:
    - data
    - a reference to the next node in the sequence
- It allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.
- A drawback to Linked Lists is the access time is linear. Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible.
- Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures.
- They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions.

## Basic Concepts and Nomenclature

- Each record of a Linked List is often called an ```element``` or ```node```.
