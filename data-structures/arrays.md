# Array

- A collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.
- An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index typle by a mathematical formula.
- The simplest type of data structure is a *linear array*, also called *one-dimensional array*.
- Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program.
- Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at *run time*.

## Applications

- Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables.
- Many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.
- Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, stings, and VLists.
- Array-based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient (implicit data structures), requiring little space overhead, but may have poor space complexity, particularly when modified, compared to tree-based data structures (compare a sorted array to a search tree).
- One or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocaiton, particularly memory pool allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate “dynamic memory” portably.
